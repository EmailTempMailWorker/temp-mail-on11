## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have following:

*   **Bun**: Installed on your system.
*   **Cloudflare Account**: With access to Workers, Email Routing, and D1.

### Project Setup

1.  **Install Dependencies**: Install necessary JavaScript dependencies.
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

2.  **Login to Cloudflare**: You need to log in to your Cloudflare account via Wrangler. This will open a browser for authentication.
    ```bash
    bun wrangler login
    ```

### Cloudflare Configuration

#### D1 Database Setup

1.  **Create** D1 database**:
    ```bash
    bun run db:create
    ```
2.  **Copy** `database_id`: From output of above command.
3.  **Update** `wrangler.jsonc`: Open `wrangler.jsonc` and replace `database_id` with `database_id` you just copied.
4.  **Apply Database Schema**:
    ```bash
    bun run db:tables
    ```
5.  **Apply Database Indexes**:
    ```bash
    bun run db:indexes
    ```

#### R2 Bucket Setup (temp blok)

1.  **Create** R2 Bucket**:
    ```bash
    bun run r2:create
    ```
2.  **Create Preview Bucket** (for development):
    ```bash
    bun run r2:create-preview
    ```

#### Email Routing Setup

1.  **Go to your Cloudflare Dashboard**: Select your domain (`example.com`).
2.  **Navigate to "Email" -> "Email Routing"**.
3.  **Enable Email Routing** if it's not already enabled.
4.  **Create a Catch-all Rule**:
    *   For "Action", choose "Send to Worker".
    *   Select your Worker (e.g., `temp-mail`).
    *   Click "Save".

## Running the Worker

### Cloudflare Information Script (Optional)

To check your Cloudflare Workers, D1 databases, and domain information directly from your terminal, you can use the `cf-info` script.

1.  **Configure API Credentials**: Add your Cloudflare Account ID and an API Token with appropriate permissions (e.g., `Zone:Read`, `Worker Scripts:Read`, `D1:Read`, `Zone:Email:Read`) to your `.dev.vars` file.

    Example `.dev.vars` additions:
    ```
    CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID="YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID"
    CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"
    ```

2.  **Run** Script**:
    ```bash
    bun run cf-info
    ```

### Telegram Logging (Optional)

If you wish to enable Telegram logging for your worker, follow these steps:

1.  **Enable Logging in `wrangler.jsonc`**: Ensure `TELEGRAM_LOG_ENABLE` is set to `true` in your `wrangler.jsonc` file under `vars` section.

2.  **Local Development (`.dev.vars`)**: For local development, create a `.dev.vars` file in your project root with your Telegram bot token and chat ID. This file is used by `bun dev`.

    Example `.dev.vars`:
    ```
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
    TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID"
    ```

3.  **Production Deployment (Secrets)**: For production, you must set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` as secrets using `wrangler`. This securely stores your sensitive information with Cloudflare.

    Run following commands in your terminal and enter respective values when prompted:
    ```bash
    bun wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
    bun wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID
    ```
